# стиль

A simple, blank dev environment we used for early web projects at [56](http://56.digital).

Configured with SCSS via Compass.

##How to Use

To use this you'll need [Compass](http://compass-style.org/).

Then, you'll need to direct to your new dev environment, and then tell Compass to watch it.

```python
cd path/to/your/project

compass watch
```

And that's it! All of your SCSS will compile to a compacted CSS sheet.
