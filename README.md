### стиль

A simple, blank dev environment that we use at [Fifty6](http://fifty6.net).
No clutter, configured with SCSS via Compass.

To use this you'll need [Compass](http://compass-style.org/).
Then, you'll need to direct to your new dev environment, and then tell Compass to watch it.

```python
cd path/to/blank

compass watch
```

And that's it! All of your SCSS will compile to a compacted CSS sheet.
